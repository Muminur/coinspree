## üóÑÔ∏è Data Models (Vercel KV)

### User Schema

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string
  email: string
  passwordHash: string
  role: 'user' | 'admin'
  isActive: boolean
  createdAt: string
  lastLogin: string
  notificationsEnabled: boolean
}
```

### Subscription Schema

```typescript
interface Subscription {
  id: string
  userId: string
  status: 'active' | 'expired' | 'blocked'
  startDate: string
  endDate: string
  paymentTxHash: string
  amount: number
}
```

### Crypto Asset Schema

```typescript
interface CryptoAsset {
  id: string // CoinGecko ID
  symbol: string
  name: string
  currentPrice: number
  marketCap: number
  marketCapRank: number
  ath: number
  athDate: string
  lastUpdated: string
}
```

## üîê Security Requirements

- **Passwords**: bcrypt hashing with salt
- **Sessions**: HTTP-only secure cookies
- **Validation**: Zod validation on all inputs
- **CSRF**: Built-in Next.js protection

## üìß Email System

- **Service**: Use Vercel-compatible email service (Resend recommended)
- **Templates**: Store in Vercel Edge Config
- **Triggers**: Real-time ATH detection
- **Content**: Coin name, new ATH, previous ATH, percentage increase
- **Unsubscribe**: Automatic when subscription expires

## üéØ Key Implementation Notes

### CoinGecko API Integration

- Free tier: 50 calls/minute
- Cache responses in Vercel KV for 1 minute
- Monitor top 100 coins by market cap
- Detect ATH by comparing current price with stored ATH

### ATH Detection Algorithm

```typescript
const detectATH = async (coins: CryptoAsset[]) => {
  for (const coin of coins) {
    const stored = await getStoredCoin(coin.id)
    if (coin.currentPrice > stored.ath) {
      // New ATH detected!
      await updateATH(coin)
      await sendNotifications(coin)
    }
  }
}
```

### Subscription Logic

- Check subscription status before sending notifications
- Auto-hide notification settings for non-subscribers
- Verify USDT payments on Tron network
- Handle subscription expiry gracefully

## üö® Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't use external databases** - Only Vercel KV
2. **Don't store large files** - Use temporary storage only
3. **Don't forget rate limiting** - Both internal and CoinGecko API
4. **Don't hardcode configs** - Use Vercel Edge Config
5. **Don't skip validation** - Validate all inputs with Zod
6. **Don't miss error handling** - Graceful degradation required

## üß™ Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Critical functions (ATH detection, validation)
- **Integration Tests**: API routes and database operations
- **Manual Testing**: Full user flows before deployment
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing with simulated users
- **Vercel Testing**: Deploy to preview for real environment testing

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

- **Vercel Analytics**: Built-in performance monitoring
- **Custom Metrics**: ATH detection rate, email delivery success
- **Error Tracking**: Log errors to Vercel for debugging
- **User Metrics**: Track active users and subscription conversions

## üîÑ Development Workflow

1. **Start Session**: Read PLANNING.md and TASKS.md
2. **Pick Task**: Choose highest priority uncompleted task
3. **Implement**: Code following Vercel constraints
4. **Test**: Verify functionality works on Vercel
5. **Mark Complete**: Update TASKS.md with ‚úÖ
6. **Deploy**: Push to Vercel for testing
7. **Document**: Update this file with learnings
