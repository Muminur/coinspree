- Strong market momentum
- Potential profit-taking opportunities
- Increased market attention and volume

### How We Detect ATHs
CoinSpree monitors the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap every minute using real-time data from CoinGecko. When we detect a new ATH:

2. ðŸ“§ **Email notification** sent immediately
3. ðŸ“Š **Dashboard update** with new ATH data
4. ðŸ“ˆ **Historical tracking** for future reference

### What You'll Receive
When a cryptocurrency hits a new ATH, you'll get an email containing:
- **Coin name and symbol** (e.g., Bitcoin - BTC)
